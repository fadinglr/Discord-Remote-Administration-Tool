# Discord Remote Administration Tool (BloodyRAT)
I made that remote administration tool a year or more ago. It was a fun project.

# How it works
It's using a discord user token to read commands from a channel and sending logs through a discord webhook.

## Note
I kinda started with coding in csharp there like almost two years ago, so don't judge me if it's coded badly.
